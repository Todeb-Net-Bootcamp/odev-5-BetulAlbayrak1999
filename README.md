### The main aim of the project is to find the easiest way for using a bank account.

Descriptions:
To explain more about the project and its needs of it: All of us know the traditional ways of using bank accounts in shopping, or in ATMs, like bank credit cards, or QR codes. Those ways could help us with using our accounts and making our transactions, but they still have many problems like if you forget your credit card and you do not have your phone around, you cannot withdraw any money from ATM. So, my project came up with a solution for this problem which is providing each customer that has a bank account with a watch. They can use it at ATMs, online shopping, or any other place instead of bank credit cards. The difference between this idea and today's used ways is that many customers face a problem like forgetting the bank credit cards in different places, but what do you think if your credit cards are shaped as a wristwatch which is something you can keep with you all time.

- In my project here I have built the DataAccess Layer.
